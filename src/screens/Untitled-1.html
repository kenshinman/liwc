  <p>Everyday news headlines break intermittently with reports of unprecedented events around the world. From severe weather
    conditions to increased terrorist activities. Economic decline and depression to political instability. These events
    take on natural, political, social, religious, economic and cultural dimensions and many of them without human answers
    or understanding. </p>
  <p>As believers we are forewarned by the Holy Scriptures of perilous times such as these (2 Timothy 3 v 1).
    <br>
    <br>Nonetheless, Isaiah 60:1-2 testifies that as the Earth becomes engulfed in gross darkness, simultaneously, the Church
    will rise and shine brighter and brighter. So the good news is that notwithstanding how the earth groans under the strain
    of sin and brokenness, we stand on the brink of what could be the greatest revival and harvests of souls before the coming
    of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. </p>

  <div>
    <p>Worship through the ministry of music and the arts will play a key role in this revival.
      <br>It is with this in mind, that the Lagos International Worship Conference has been put together â€“ to equip, prepare
      and fortify music ministers, worshippers and believers with requisite knowledge and faith-based principles for effectiveness
      and relevance in these last days.
      <br>We earnestly urge you to join this army of worshippers as we come to be instructed and imparted by the Holy Ghost.</p>
